Hello! Welcome to "Lounge Legend". A custom discord bot I made for my personal server.
I add more commands as I need them and I am a novice coder so some things may take time.
Currently tinkering with a temp voice channel function (still looking into this one lol).
You can fork & host this project as your own, just modify it to fit your needs.
Feel free to message me with any questions!
```
exampleconfig.json

{
	"prefix": "!",
	"token": "", //leave blank, put bot token in secrets tab on replit
	"owner": "your-client-ID",
	"client_id": "bots-client-ID",
	"test_guild_id": "your-test-guild-ID"
}
```
