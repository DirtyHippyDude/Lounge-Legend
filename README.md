Hello! Welcome to "Lounge Legend" a custom discord bot i made for my personal server.
I add more commands as I need them and I am a novice coder so some things may take time.
Currently looking to add a temp voice channel function (still learning this one lol)
Fork & host this project as your own if you want.
Message me with any questions!

	"owner": "your-client-ID",
	"client_id": "bots-client-ID",
	"test_guild_id": "your-test-guild-ID"
}
